# DVD Pila! Desktop

A version of DVD Pila! Desktop developed using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).


## Why?

Because the Java version of DVD Pila! Desktop didn't easily play the [Matroska](https://matroska.org/) files I archived my DVD collection in.

So a HTML5 video element in an Electron app should do just fine.

Also, using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/) and [Reat](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for the front-end.

## Prerequisites

You're going to need a local install of [DVD Pila!](http://dvdpila.thehoick.com/) on your network to point the desktop app to.  The JSON REST API is used to  list and play DVD archives.
